#Meet Me half way


The project has been designed to present options on a map for people to meet half way between their homes or workplaces.
First , using the google API to calculate the midpoint between locations based on their longitudes and latitudes, the
code will then populate the map with destinations based on the user's preference. The user may choose to meet from a list of google API place types,for example, a bar, cafe, bookshop or a church within
an area (in KM) decided by the user.

#Quick Guide

The user types in
1. Address 1- The user's starting point in the form of the nearest town.
2. Address 2- The starting point, also in the form of an address, of the person they are meeting.
3. Their choice of types of places to meet are selected using checkboxes.
4. The user clicks a show button.

A selection of places the user chose are marked on the map around the half way point.

The simplest solution to this was a mathmatical calculation using the two longitudinal and two latitudinal stating points.
